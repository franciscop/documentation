# Documentation Page

The official docs for [Documentation Page](https://documentation.page/). Talk about dogfeeding ðŸ¤—


## Getting Started

There is a high chance that your documentation already works properly! Try it out by searching your repos in our homepage:

https://documentation.page/

You can organize your documentation broadly in three different ways:

- Single **readme.md** file. Ideal for smaller projects, you can put all the docs in this file and call it a day. [See example](https://documentation.page/github/sindresorhus/meow/).
- Folder **documentation** with multiple markdown files. These will all be concatenated in alphabetic order to generate the full documentation. (TODO: examples).
- Custom **documentation.page.json** configuration if you want a different personalized docs organization. See [example config](https://github.com/franciscop/react-test/blob/master/documentation.page.json) with [output website](https://react-test.dev/).



## Convention

This is the most powerful bit, since we will crawl your repository looking for some specific helpful bits and use that to generate the website. When possible, we recommend following the convention first, and otherwise adding [some custom configuration](#configuration).

The data that is parsed automatically is similar to the configuration available:

| key         | description                                    | source                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| name        | very short identifier for the project          | Github API's repo `name`, cleaned up                |
| title       | longer identifier for the project              | Same as `name`                                      |
| description | a paragraph summarizing the project            | Github API's repo `description`                     |
| logo        | absolute path pointing to your project logo    | Any file found called `favicon.png` or `logo.png`   |
| menu        | the top-right menu links for custom domains    | Configuration **required** for custom domains       |
| pages       | list the files/folders to crawl                | `documentation` if found or `readme.md` otherwise   |



## Configuration

These are the documentation options right now:

| key         | description                                    | example                                             |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| name        | very short identifier for the project          | Statux                                              |
| title       | longer identifier for the project              | Statux â€¢ The easy React state management library    |
| description | a paragraph summarizing the project            | A straightforward way of dealing with your ...      |
| logo        | absolute path pointing to your project logo    | https://example.com/mylogo.png                      |
| menu        | the top-right menu links for custom domains    | { "Donate": "...", "Github": "...", ... }           |
| pages       | list the files/folders to crawl                | \["readme.md", "documentation", "examples", ...\]   |

They are the keys of a JSON file, which can be either of these:

- `documentation.page.json`: a file on the root of the project
- `documentation/page.json`: a file called `page.json` inside a folder called `documentation`
- [not yet] the key `documentation` inside your `package.json`


### name

A very short name to identify the project. It must be the name of the project and nothing else, and so it excludes the tag line, icon, etc. It will be visible in:

- Tab title
- Navbar title (Pro)


### title

Longer identifier for the project, possibly stating the tagline. It will be visible in:

- Google search main title
- Share card preview main title


### description

A paragraph summarizing the project funcionality and competitive advantages. This appears in:

- Google search description
- Share card preview description


### logo

An absolute path to the image associated with the logo of your project. It can only be in `.png` right now. It will show on:

- Favicon
- Navbar before the project name


### menu 

the top-right menu links for custom domains. It is an object with the labels (text) as the keys, and the links as the URLs. Example:

```json
{
  "menu": {
    "Issues": "https://github.com/franciscop/react-test/issues",
    "Contribute": "https://github.com/franciscop/react-test/blob/master/Contributing.md",
    "Donate": "https://www.paypal.me/franciscopresencia/19",
    "Github": "https://github.com/franciscop/react-test"
  }
}
```


### pages

Where the data should be searched. Defaults to `heroreadme.md`. It IS case insensitive. Example:

```json
{
  "pages": ["readme.md", "src/methods", "src/jest-matchers", "src/examples"]
}
```



## Guides

### Moving OUT of Documentation Page

I created Documentation Page to be a place where developers can easily semi-automate their docs websites, not to lock them in. So if at some point, for some reason you decide to move out into e.g. Github Pages, please feel free to do so! There are [some disadvantages](#github-pages) but these might not affect you.

The easiest and probably best way of making your Github Pages is having a single markdown file with all of the docs. Then you can either have a script that converts that into a full HTML page locally, or using a Jekyll template that converts it into an HTML page on Github pages.
